Incremovable Subarray Count  
Date: 03-01-2025  
Platform: LeetCode  
Difficulty: Medium  

Problem Understanding  
- Input: An integer array `nums` of size `n`.  
- Output: Return the number of subarrays that can be removed such that the remaining array is strictly increasing.  
- Constraints:  
  - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 1000.  
  - Each element in `nums` can range from 1 to 1000.  
- Edge Cases:  
  - The array is already strictly increasing.  
  - The array consists of all identical elements.  
  - Removing the entire array still results in a valid increasing sequence (empty case).  

Approach  

1. Initial Thoughts  
   - A brute-force approach can iterate over all possible subarrays and check if the remaining array is strictly increasing.  
   - Given the constraints (n â‰¤ 1000), an O(nÂ³) approach is acceptable.  

2. Optimal Solution  
   - Use nested loops to consider all subarrays `[i, j]` for removal.  
   - Check whether the remaining elements form a strictly increasing sequence.  
   - If valid, increment the answer count.  
   - This approach runs in O(nÂ³) time, which is feasible given the constraints.  

3. Time & Space Complexity  
   - Time Complexity: O(nÂ³) due to three nested loops.  
   - Space Complexity: O(1) since only a few integer variables are used.  

Code Implementation  
```java
class Solution {
    public int incremovableSubarrayCount(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                boolean ok = true;
                int lst = -1;

                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    if (k >= i && k <= j) {
                        continue;
                    } else {
                        ok &= (lst < nums[k]);
                        lst = nums[k];
                    }
                }

                ans += ok ? 1 : 0;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Review Notes  
- Key Insights  
  - The problem is solvable with brute force due to the small constraints.  
  - The condition `lst < nums[k]` ensures the remaining array is strictly increasing.  
- Common Mistakes  
  - Not considering the edge case where removing the entire array is valid.  
  - Incorrectly handling the boolean condition for sequence validation.  
- Optimization Tips  
  - If constraints were larger, a more optimized approach would be needed (e.g., binary search or dynamic programming).
