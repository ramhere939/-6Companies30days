**Ways to Split Array**  
Date: 03-01-2025  
Platform: LeetCode  
Difficulty: Medium  

**Problem Understanding**  
- Input: An integer array `nums` of size `n`.  
- Output: Return the number of ways to split `nums` into two parts such that the sum of the left part is at least as large as the sum of the right part.  
- Constraints:  
  - The length of `nums` is between 2 and 100,000.  
  - Each element in `nums` can range from -10,000,000 to 10,000,000.  
- Edge Cases:  
  - The array contains negative numbers.  
  - The array has a large size, so an efficient solution is needed.  
  - All elements in the array are the same.  

**Approach**  

1. **Initial Thoughts**  
   A brute-force approach would be to check every possible split point and compute the sum of both parts. However, this would result in an inefficient O(nÂ²) time complexity.  

2. **Optimal Solution**  
   - We use prefix sum to efficiently determine valid split points.  
   - First, compute the total sum of the array.  
   - Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (left sum).  
   - If at any index `i`, `left sum * 2 â‰¥ total sum`, increment the count.  
   - This solution works in O(n) time since we only traverse the array twice.  
   - The space complexity is O(1) since we use only a few extra variables.  

3. **Time & Space Complexity**  
   - Time Complexity: O(n)  
   - Space Complexity: O(1)  

**Code Implementation**  
```java
public int waysToSplitArray(int[] nums) {
    long total = 0, left = 0;
    for (int num : nums) total += num;
    
    int count = 0, n = nums.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        left += nums[i];
        if (2 * left >= total) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

**Review Notes**  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - The problem simplifies to checking prefix sums at each index.  
  - The condition `left sum â‰¥ right sum` can be rewritten as `2 * left sum â‰¥ total sum`, avoiding unnecessary calculations.  
- **Common Mistakes:**  
  - Not handling negative numbers correctly.  
  - Forgetting to use `long` to avoid integer overflow in large cases.  
- **Optimization Tips:**  
  - Using a single pass after computing the total sum minimizes unnecessary iterations.  
  - An alternative approach could use binary search on prefix sums for certain variations of this problem.
