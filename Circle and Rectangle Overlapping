Here's the plain text version:

Your implementation is correct and aligns well with the explanation I provided earlier. Here's a breakdown of what your code does:

Key Steps in Your Code

1. Determine the Closest Point:
   For the x-coordinate:
      If the circle's center xCenter lies within the rectangle's horizontal bounds [x1,x2], the closest point's x-coordinate is xCenter itself.
      Otherwise, the closest x-coordinate is either the left edge x1 (if xCenter<x1) or the right edge x2 (if xCenter>x2).
   Similarly, for the y-coordinate:
      If yCenter is within [y1,y2], the closest point's y-coordinate is yCenter.
      Otherwise, it's y1 or y2.

2. Calculate the Distance:
   Compute the distance between the circle's center and the closest point using the Pythagorean theorem, avoiding the square root for efficiency by working with squared values: distanceSquared = (x - xCenter)^2 + (y - yCenter)^2

3. Check the Radius Condition:
   If the squared distance is less than or equal to the square of the radius (r^2), then the circle overlaps with the rectangle: distanceSquared <= r^2

Your Code Analysis

Correctness:
It accurately determines the closest point and performs the radius check. This handles all cases:
   Circle's center inside the rectangle.
   Circle overlapping the rectangle.
   Circle just touching the rectangle.
   Circle far away from the rectangle.

Efficiency:
Time Complexity: O(1)
   The calculations involve simple comparisons and arithmetic operations.
Space Complexity: O(1)
   No additional memory is used.

Readability:
The logic is clean and easy to understand.

Comments for Better Understanding
Here's your code with comments for clarity:

public boolean checkOverlap(int r, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    // Finding the nearest point on the rectangle to the circle's center
    int x, y;
    
    // Closest x-coordinate
    if (x1 <= xCenter && xCenter <= x2) 
        x = xCenter; // xCenter is within the rectangle's horizontal bounds
    else if (xCenter < x1) 
        x = x1; // xCenter is to the left of the rectangle
    else 
        x = x2; // xCenter is to the right of the rectangle

    // Closest y-coordinate
    if (y1 <= yCenter && yCenter <= y2) 
        y = yCenter; // yCenter is within the rectangle's vertical bounds
    else if (yCenter < y1) 
        y = y1; // yCenter is below the rectangle
    else 
        y = y2; // yCenter is above the rectangle

    // Calculate squared distance between circle's center and closest point
    int x_distance = x - xCenter;
    int y_distance = y - yCenter;
    
    // Check if the distance is within the circle's radius
    return (x_distance * x_distance) + (y_distance * y_distance) <= r * r;
}

Test Cases

Case 1: Circle Center Inside Rectangle
Input: r = 5, xCenter = 4, yCenter = 4, x1 = 3, y1 = 3, x2 = 7, y2 = 6
Closest Point: (4,4)
Distance: 0
Output: true

Case 2: Circle Just Touching Rectangle
Input: r = 3, xCenter = 5, yCenter = 8, x1 = 3, y1 = 5, x2 = 7, y2 = 6
Closest Point: (5,6)
Distance: 2^2 = 4
r^2 = 9, so 4 <= 9
Output: true

Case 3: Circle Far Away from Rectangle
Input: r = 2, xCenter = 10, yCenter = 10, x1 = 3, y1 = 3, x2 = 7, y2 = 6
Closest Point: (7,6)
Distance: (10-7)^2 + (10-6)^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
r^2 = 4, so 25 > 4
Output: false

This implementation is robust and handles all edge cases.
